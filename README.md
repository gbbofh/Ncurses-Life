# Conway's Life #

This is just a fun experiment I did near the end of last semester. There are a
lot of improvements that could be made. It starts to run excruciatingly slow
when there are a large number of living cells. I don't know how to fix this,
but I do know that there is most likely a way to speed up the drawing.
